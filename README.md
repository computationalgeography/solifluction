# Solifluction

**Numerical simulation of solifluction processes**

Solifluction is a numerical simulation package based on the finite difference method (FDM) and the [LUE](https://lue.computationalgeography.org) library.  
It models solifluction as a multiphase process involving muddy soil movement and ice sheet expansion or dissipation.  
The model solves the mass conservation, momentum conservation, and heat transfer equations to simulate the coupled dynamics of soil and ice.

## Features
- Finite difference method (FDM) solver
- Multiphase modeling: muddy soil and ice sheets
- Mass, momentum, and heat conservation equations
- Built using [LUE](https://lue.computationalgeography.org)
